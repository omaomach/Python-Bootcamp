# Rule of defining a variable in Python
# Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
# They can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age and Age are different)
# Avoid using Python keywords (e.g if, for, while) as variable names
